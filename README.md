Gram Quadrature and a few other algorithms

We upload here, an implementation of gram quadrature in python, as well as other quadrature rules that were played with.
The work is from the article: [Gram quadrature: numerical integration with Gram polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14875) 

An implementation in R was created by [Iago Giné-Vázquez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6725-2638),
and can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GramQuad/index.html).
